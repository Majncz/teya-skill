# Poslink overview

Poslink is Teya's solution for **in-person card payments**, designed to connect your ePOS directly with a Teya card machine through secure **cloud communication**. Instead of relying on local network setups or complex hardware, Poslink provides a streamlined way for your point of sale to talk to the payment terminal.  

With this integration, every transaction initiated from your ePOS is passed seamlessly to the card machine, and the payment response is returned in real time. This allows you to manage the full payment journey — from initiation to confirmation — within your ePOS, while the Teya terminal handles card processing securely.   

Whether you're running a single shop or managing multiple locations, Poslink gives you the flexibility to integrate payments directly into your checkout experience, with minimal setup effort and maximum control.  

## General Flow

1. The ePOS system initiates API calls to create, cancel, or retrieve payment requests.
2. The Teya terminal fetches the corresponding payment requests.
3. The Teya terminal then attempts to process the fetched payment requests.
